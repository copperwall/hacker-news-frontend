# HN Front End

So HN has an API for grabbing user, item, and top post information, so I
thought I'd try to make a nice frontend for it. I'm not super pleased with any
of the android apps I've tried so I'm going to see if I can make a web app that
I feel is good enough to be a replacement for the android app.
